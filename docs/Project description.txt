Project description

Build an internal “Chargebacks Automation” dashboard that generates chargeback documents from Google Docs templates stored in a Shared Drive. Admin users create a new chargeback by choosing a template and entering an order ID and title. The backend duplicates the selected template, replaces placeholders, and saves the generated document into a “Generated” folder. The system stores each generated chargeback record with metadata (title, template, order ID, created date, created by) and the resulting Google Doc URL.

Stage 1 focuses on Google integration only: load templates from Google Drive, duplicate a template, update a single test placeholder field to confirm replacement works, and save the new document. WooCommerce order/customer auto-fill is planned for a later stage.
